# Ghost-Words

Players build a word by adding one letter each turn, while trying to force their opponent to complete the word.If a player believes a word has been completed, or that a word cannot be formed with the letters played thus far, he may challenge. If the other player can form a word by adding new letters, she wins. Otherwise, she loses.
